      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Reese Gerjekian, a creative spirit born and raised in Michigan. My journey is a blend of technology, creativity, and a deep love for the simple joys of life.&#xA;My Roots and Passions Link to heading Growing up in Michigan, I was always fascinated by the endless possibilities of creating something new. This passion didn&amp;rsquo;t just stay confined to technology; it expanded into various realms such as developing websites (like this one), curating content for my blog, immersing myself in the world of literature, enjoying music, strategizing in chess, engaging in games with friends, and, above all, cherishing moments with my family.</description>

      <description>The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3(x) + 1 conjecture, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It proposes a sequence defined by the following rules: Start with any positive integer x. If x is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture posits that no matter the starting number, the sequence will eventually reach the value 1.&#xA;Copy Code # importing the required module import matplotlib.</description>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence is a fundamental mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. It has numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, biology, art, and computer science and appears in natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the spirals in a seashell.</description>

      <description>The Goldbach Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in number theory that dates back to 1742. It was first proposed by the German mathematician Christian Goldbach, who wrote a letter to the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in which he stated that &amp;ldquo;every positive even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Copy Code # Program to check if a number is prime or not num = 3 prime = [] # To take input from the user # num = int(input(&#34;</description>

      <guid>https://rgerjeki.github.io/password-checker-in-python/</guid>
      <description>The program defines a function, password_strength, that evaluates the strength of a provided password based on several criteria: length, presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It returns a string describing the password&amp;rsquo;s strength as either &amp;ldquo;Weak&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Medium&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Strong&amp;rdquo;. When run as a standalone script, the program prompts the user to input a password and then displays the strength assessment of the entered password.&#xA;Password Strength Checker Python Script Copy Code import re def password_strength(password): if len(password) &amp;lt; 8: return &#34;</description>

      <description>This program is a Random Password Generator designed to enhance online security. By specifying the desired password length, users can create strong passwords that combine lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.&#xA;Copy Code import random import math alpha = &#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#34; num = &#34;0123456789&#34; special = &#34;@#$%&amp;*&#34; # pass_len=random.randint(8,13) #without User INput pass_len = int(input(&#34;Enter Password Length&#34;)) # length of password by 50-30-20 formula alpha_len = pass_len//2 num_len = math.</description>

      <description>The twin prime conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in number theory that deals with the distribution of twin prime numbers. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), and so on. The twin prime conjecture states that there are an infinite number of twin prime pairs.&#xA;Copy Code # Program to check if a number is prime or not num = 3 prime = [] # To take input from the user # num = int(input(&#34;</description>
