description = "The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3(x) + 1 conjecture, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It proposes a sequence defined by the following rules: Start with any positive integer x. If x is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture posits that no matter the starting number, the sequence will eventually reach the value 1."
