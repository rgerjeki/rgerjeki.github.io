description = "The Fibonacci sequence is a fundamental mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. It has numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, biology, art, and computer science and appears in natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the spirals in a seashell."
