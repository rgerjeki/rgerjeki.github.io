The twin prime conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in number theory that deals with the distribution of twin prime numbers. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), and so on. The twin prime conjecture states that there are an infinite number of twin prime pairs.
